     This is a project built during the reinvention jam of *handmade network*!

     Why use DNS when you can use torrents ?

     Creating torrent files is easy. Just use the create torrent button from the UI in
     qBitTorrent. Select Private to avoid DHT, so that only people with the magnet get the
     torrent.

     You can download a torrent folder with the of the helper script.
     You will need to enable qBitTorrent's Web UI mode to use the script.

     To run your own tracker you can use `opentracker`.
