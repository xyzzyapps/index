     # Welcome to Index!

     This is a project built during the reinvention jam of handmade network!

     Index is a browser with some twists. Some of the things considered for reinventing

     1. DNS with magnet links. *partially done*
     2. Markdown instead of html. *done*
     3. Support images, svg, video, image maps. *done*
     4. Form submit will send an (encrypted ) email with personal details. *partially done*
     5. Integrated payment. *not done*
     6. Mobile app. *not done*
     7. Xanadu style transclusions with  authorisation support. *authorisation and connection visualisations are not implemented*
     8. Simpler CSS / DOM with lua or yaml. *done*

     Currently the project uses Python3 and PyQt.
