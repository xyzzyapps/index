     From discord,

    - Search contents of all cached pages at once.
    - Ctrl+F search all tabs at once
    - Ctrl+F search backwards in history
    - Bookmarks/favorites with tags and notes (notes are pages themselves with links and everything?)
    - Special treatment of cache for favorited pages (e.g. Clear cache except favorited pages)
    - "Versioned cache"/automatic archiving
    - Read-later tree
    - Visual search. Draw a picture, program renders all cached pages or goes backwards in history and compares.
    - Button/input that generates word cloud of page (not useful, but vaguely interesting to look at).
    - History of visited pages saved as a tree/graph rather than a line.
    - "Window manager features" to layout tabs within the window. Picture-in-picture stuff?
    - For the current page, show in UI:
    - - Cache date
    - - File(s)/resources size
    - - Download speed while downloading
    - First-class "wiki support" for all pages. e.g. inline comments, edit-suggestions, adding translations
